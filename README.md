### Initial Setup

1. **Open the Remote File Browser**
   - Click the globe icon (üåê) in the activity bar on the left side of your editor

2. **Add Your First Connection**
   - Click **"Manage Connections"** in the welcome screen
   - Click the green **"‚ûï Add New Connection"** button to show the connection form
   - Fill out the connection form:
     - **Connection Name**: A friendly name for your server
     - **Protocol**: SFTP (recommended) or FTP
     - **Host**: Your server's IP address or domain name
     - **Port**: Usually 22 for SFTP, 21 for FTP
     - **Username**: Your server username (optional for anonymous FTP)
     - **Authentication**: Choose Password or SSH Key (SFTP only - supports OpenSSH and PuTTY .ppk v2/v3 formats)
     - **Password**: Optional - enter to store securely, or leave empty to prompt during connection
     - **Anonymous FTP**: Check this box for anonymous FTP access (FTP only)
     - **Remote Path**: Starting directory (usually `/`)

3. **Save and Connect**
   - Click **"Add Connection"** to save (the form will automatically hide after saving)
   - Click the **"Connect"** button next to your new connection
   - If no password was stored, you'll be prompted to enter it
   - Choose **"Yes"** to save credentials securely for future connections

### Connection Management

#### Cloning Connections
- Click **"Clone"** button next to any saved connection to duplicate it
- Cloned connections are automatically prefixed with "copy of " 
- Perfect for setting up similar server environments (dev, staging, production)
- Edit the cloned connection to customize host, port, or other settings

## Daily Usage

### Quick Connect
- Click the globe icon (üåê) to see your recent connections
- Expand **"Recent Connections"** to see up to 10 saved servers
- **Single-click** any connection name to connect instantly (double-clicking is not necessary)
- **Right-click options**:
  - **Manage Connections** item: Right-click to access **"Add New Connection"** option
  - **Individual connections**: Right-click for **"Edit Connection"**, **"Clone"**, and **"Delete Connection"** options

### Browsing Files
- Once connected, browse files in the **"Remote Files"** tree view
- Folders show first, then files (both alphabetically sorted)
- Double-click any file to open and edit it
- Use the **arrow-up button** (‚¨ÜÔ∏è) in the toolbar to navigate to parent directories
- Select directories in the tree to use as upload destinations for local files

**üí° Tip: Better Tree Indentation**
If nested folders are hard to see, increase VSCode's tree indentation:
1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "tree indent"
3. Change **"Workbench ‚Ä∫ Tree: Indent"** from 8 to 16 or 20 pixels
4. This improves visibility for all tree views in VSCode!

**üí° Tip: Customizing File Opening Behavior**
Some users prefer different file opening behaviors. You can customize these in VSCode settings:
1. Open Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`)
2. **Disable Preview Tabs**: Search for "workbench.editor.enablePreview" and set it to `false`
   - This prevents files from opening in preview mode (italic tab names)
   - Every file click will open in a permanent tab instead
3. **Require Double-Click**: Search for "workbench.list.openMode" and change it to `"doubleClick"`
   - This requires double-clicking to open files instead of single-clicking
   - Applies to all tree views in VSCode, not just Remote File Browser
4. These settings affect all VSCode file operations, providing a consistent experience across the editor

### Editing Files
- Files open instantly in your editor
- Make changes and save normally (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`)
- Changes are automatically uploaded to the remote server
- You'll see a confirmation message when upload completes

### Uploading Local Files to Remote Server
- Open any local file in VSCode/Cursor
- **Right-click on the file tab** at the top of the editor
- Select **"Push to Remote"** from the context menu

#### Smart Upload Destinations
- **Regular local files**: Upload directly to currently selected directory in remote tree
- **Temporary files** (from `/tmp/`): Get choice between two destinations:
  - **"Original Location"**: Upload back to where the file was originally downloaded from
  - **"Current Location"**: Upload to currently selected directory in remote tree
- **Note**: For regular files, you must first select a directory in the remote file tree as the upload destination

3. Edit the `remoteFileBrowser.connections` array directly

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "remoteFileBrowser.connections": [
    {
      "name": "Production Server",
      "protocol": "sftp",
      "host": "prod.example.com",
      "port": 22,
      "username": "deploy",
      "remotePath": "/var/www",
      "authType": "key",
      "keyPath": "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa",
      "connectionTimeout": 20000,
      "operationTimeout": 90000,
      "maxRetries": 5,
      "enableKeepAlive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: All advanced timeout and retry parameters are optional. If not specified, sensible defaults are used:
- Connection timeouts: 20s (SFTP), 30s (FTP)
- Operation timeout: 60s
- Max retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- Keep-alive: Enabled with 30s intervals

## How Temporary Files Work

### File Storage Structure
When you open remote files, they're downloaded to your local system in an organized structure:

```
/tmp/remote-file-browser/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-at-server1-22/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/user/config.txt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/nginx/nginx.conf
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ var/log/app.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-at-server2-21/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ web/index.html
```

### Connection-Specific Directories
- Each connection gets its own folder named `username-at-hostname-port`
- The remote directory structure is preserved locally
- This prevents filename conflicts between different servers

### File Caching Behavior
- **First Open**: File is downloaded from the remote server
- **Subsequent Opens**: You're asked to choose:
  - **"Override with fresh copy from server"** - Downloads latest version
  - **"Open existing local copy"** - Uses cached version
  - **"Cancel"** - Closes the dialog

### Auto-Sync on Save
- When you save a file (`Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`), changes are automatically uploaded
- You'll see a confirmation message: "Uploaded filename.txt to remote server"
- If upload fails, you'll see an error message with details

## Managing Temporary Files

### Viewing Temp Files
1. Open the connection manager (click globe icon ‚Üí "Manage Connections")
2. Click **"üíª View tmp files in shell"**
3. A terminal opens in the temp directory showing all downloaded files
4. Use standard shell commands to explore: `ls -la`, `cd`, `cat`, etc.

### Cleaning Up Temp Files

#### Clean Up Current Connection Files
**Warning**: This will delete temporary files for the current connection and break sync for any open files from this server.

1. **Via Navigation Bar** (when connected):
   - Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to refresh and disconnect
   - This runs "Clean Up Connection Temp Files"

2. **Via Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
   - Type "Clean Up Connection Temp Files" and select it

#### Clean Up All Connection Files
**Warning**: This will delete ALL temporary files from ALL connections and break sync for any open files.

1. **Via Connection Manager**:
   - Click **"üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Temp Files"** in the connection manager
   - This runs "Clean Up All Temp Files"

2. **Via Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
   - Type "Clean Up All Temp Files" and select it

### What Cleanup Does
- Deletes the entire `/tmp/remote-file-browser/` directory
- Removes all downloaded files from all connections
- Clears file watchers to prevent memory leaks
- Shows count of deleted files when complete

### After Cleanup
- Any files you have open will no longer sync when saved
- Next time you open a remote file, it will be downloaded fresh
- Your saved connections and credentials remain intact

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **"All configured authentication methods failed"**: Check username/password or SSH key path
- **"Connection refused"**: Verify host, port, and that SSH/FTP service is running
- **"Host key verification failed"**: Accept the host key when prompted
- **"Failed to convert PPK file"**: Check that your PPK file is valid and enter the correct passphrase if the key is encrypted

### Keyring Issues (Linux)
If you see "keyring couldn't be identified":
- Install a keyring manager: `sudo apt install gnome-keyring` (Ubuntu) or similar
- Or choose "Continue Without Saving" to skip credential storage

### Temp File Access Issues
- **Crostini/ChromeOS**: Temp files are in the Linux container, use the shell interface
- **File not syncing**: Check if you cleaned up temp files, re-open the file to re-establish sync
- **Permission errors**: Ensure you have write access to the remote directory

## Security Notes

- **Credentials**: Stored securely in your OS keychain (not in settings files)
- **SSH Keys**: Read from disk only during connection, not cached in memory
- **PPK Files**: PuTTY .ppk files (v2 and v3) are converted to OpenSSH format in memory for security
- **Temp Files**: Use sanitized names to prevent path traversal attacks
- **Network**: All connections use standard SFTP/FTP protocols with your authentication

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Multi-Window Limitations

**Important**: Be careful when using multiple VSCode/Cursor windows with this extension to avoid data loss.

### Known Issues
- **Same Server Conflicts**: Multiple windows connecting to the same server share temp file storage, which can cause file conflicts
- **Data Loss Risk**: If two windows edit the same remote file, whichever saves last will overwrite the other's changes
- **Sync Disruption**: Running "Clean Up All Temp Files" in one window stops file synchronization in ALL windows; "Clean Up Connection Temp Files" only affects the current connection

### How to Avoid Problems
‚úÖ **Safe Usage Patterns**:
- Use only **one window per remote server**
- Connect different windows to **different servers**
- Use **different user accounts** on the same server from different windows

‚ùå **Avoid These Scenarios**:
- Two windows connected to `user@production-server.com`
- Opening the same file (`/app/config.php`) from multiple windows
- Running temp file cleanup while other windows have active connections

### If You Must Use Multiple Windows
1. **Coordinate file access** - Don't edit the same files simultaneously
2. **Avoid cleanup operations** - Don't run "Clean Up All Temp Files" while other windows are active
3. **Save frequently** - Minimize time between edits to reduce conflict windows
4. **Check for conflicts** - If sync stops working, disconnect and reconnect

Future versions will include better multi-window isolation to prevent these issues.
