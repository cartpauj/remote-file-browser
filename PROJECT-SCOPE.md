## Security Considerations
- Credentials stored using VSCode SecretStorage API
- SSH keys read from disk only during connection
- No credential caching in memory beyond connection duration
- PuTTY .ppk files handled natively by ssh2 library without format conversion
- SSH key processing happens securely in memory without temporary file creation
- Temporary files organized in connection-specific directories with sanitized names
- Manual cleanup of temporary files and watchers prevents sensitive data accumulation
- Cross-platform filesystem safety with character sanitization for folder names

## Connection Identification System

The extension uses a multi-layered approach to connection identification, with different ID formats optimized for specific purposes:

### 1. File System Paths (Safe Directory Names)
- **Format**: `username-host-port` (e.g., `admin-example.com-22`)
- **Function**: `getConnectionTempDir()` ‚Üí `sanitizeFileName()`
- **Purpose**: Creating temporary directories that are safe across all operating systems
- **Sanitization**: Converts unsafe characters (`@`, `:`, `\`, `/`, etc.) to safe alternatives
- **Usage**: Temp file storage at `/tmp/remote-file-browser/{sanitized-name}/`

### 2. File Watcher Tracking (Logical Identification)
- **Format**: `username@host:port` (e.g., `admin@example.com:22`)
- **Function**: `generateConnectionId()`
- **Purpose**: Logical identification for file watchers and connection validation
- **Human-readable**: Used in error messages and user feedback
- **Usage**: Tracking which connection each opened file belongs to for security validation

### 3. Credential Storage (Unique Keys)
- **Format**: `protocol-username-host-port` (e.g., `sftp-admin-example.com-22`)
- **Function**: `CredentialManager.generateConnectionId()`
- **Purpose**: Unique credential storage keys that differentiate between protocols
- **Protocol-aware**: Prevents SFTP and FTP credentials from conflicting on same server
- **Usage**: VSCode SecretStorage API keys for passwords and passphrases

### Connection Cleanup Implementation
- **File Tree Trash Icon**: Deletes temp files for current connection only (uses filesystem-safe directory targeting)
- **Connection Manager Cleanup**: Deletes temp files for ALL connections (global cleanup)
- **File Watcher Cleanup**: Uses logical connection IDs to dispose watchers for specific connections
- **Security Validation**: Prevents files from being saved to wrong servers using logical connection matching

### Welcome Screen Command Architecture
- **Dynamic Command Registration**: Pre-registers individual commands for each connection index at extension startup
- **Argument-Free Design**: Commands like `remoteFileBrowser.connectFromWelcome.2` eliminate VSCode argument parsing issues
- **Double-Click Prevention**: Global connection lock (`isAnyConnectionInProgress`) prevents concurrent connection attempts
- **Scalable Registration**: Loop-based registration supports configurable number of connections (default: 20)

## Known Limitations
- Requires system keyring software for secure credential storage
- Large files may impact performance during transfer
- No support for SFTP/FTP advanced features (tunneling, etc.)
- Limited to password and private key authentication (no certificates, multi-factor, etc.)
- Recent connections based on order in configuration (not actual usage tracking)
- Temp file management uses terminal interface for all platforms

### Multi-Window Compatibility Issues
- **Shared Temporary Directory Conflicts**: Multiple VSCode/Cursor windows connecting to the same server use identical temp file paths (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/user-at-server-22/`), causing file overwrite conflicts when opening the same remote files
- **Global File Watcher State**: File watchers are stored in Node.js global scope, causing cross-window interference when one window cleans up temp files (disposes watchers for all windows)
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple windows editing the same remote file can overwrite each other's changes, with whichever saves last winning
- **Cleanup Side Effects**: Running "Clean Up Temp Files" in one window affects file synchronization in all other windows
- **No Connection Isolation**: Extension lacks prevention mechanisms for multiple windows connecting to the same server simultaneously

## Security Improvements

### Connection-Aware File Watchers (Implemented)
- **Cross-Connection Upload Prevention**: File watchers now track which connection each file belongs to, preventing dangerous scenarios where files could be uploaded to the wrong server
- **Connection Validation on Save**: Before uploading any file, the system validates that the user is still connected to the same server that originally provided the file
- **Clear Error Messages**: When attempting to save a file from a different connection, users receive clear feedback like "Cannot save index.php - file belongs to user@serverA:22 but you're connected to admin@serverB:21"
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Uses existing sanitization and path handling systems to work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Breaking Changes**: Implementation preserves all existing functionality while adding safety validation

### Impact
This fix prevents data loss scenarios where:
- User opens file from Server A, disconnects, connects to Server B, and saves changes (would previously upload to Server B)
- Multi-server workflows could accidentally overwrite files on production servers with development content
- Files could be uploaded to wrong environments without user awareness

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Connection & Performance Improvements
- **Connection Pool Management**: Multiple simultaneous operations with connection lifecycle management
- **Connection Health Dashboard**: Visual dashboard showing connection metrics, uptime, and failure rates
- **Advanced Connection Profiles**: Server-specific connection settings and environment configurations
- **Connection Load Balancing**: Multiple server endpoints with automatic failover

### User Interface & Workflow

- Transfer progress indicators for large files
- Multiple file operations (copy, move, delete)
- Advanced SFTP features (symbolic links, permissions)
- Connection import/export
- Dark theme customization for connection manager
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Usage-based recent connections tracking

- Batch file operations and multi-selection support
- Connection grouping and organization features
- Directory creation and deletion from tree view
- Bulk file upload (drag and drop multiple files)
- File permissions management in remote directories
- Breadcrumb navigation for current directory path

### Multi-Window Safety Improvements
- **Window-Specific Temp Directories**: Use window/instance identifiers in temp paths to prevent conflicts (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/window-${id}/user-at-server-22/`)
- **Instance-Level File Watchers**: Replace global file watcher state with per-window instance storage
- **Connection Locking**: Implement filesystem-based or process-level locking to prevent multiple windows from connecting to the same server
- **File Access Coordination**: Add file locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent edits of the same remote file across windows
- **Isolated Cleanup Operations**: Ensure temp file cleanup only affects the current window's resources
- **Connection State Visibility**: Add indicators showing which window is connected to which server

- **Development**: `npm run compile` or `npm run watch` (auto-rebuild on changes)
- **Pre-Release Testing**: `npm run package` (production build with webpack bundling)
- **Publishing**: Automatically triggered by `vsce publish` or `vsce package`

### Complete Release Workflow

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Follow these steps in exact order for successful releases!**

**üö® CRITICAL REMINDER: VSCode extensions require TWO publishing steps:**
1. **Git Release**: `npm version patch/minor/major` + `git push --tags` (version control)
2. **Marketplace Release**: `vsce publish` (make available to users)

**Both steps are required for a complete release!**

#### Step-by-Step Release Process

1. **Check Git Status**
   ```bash
   # Ensure working directory is clean or commit pending changes
   git status
   
   # If changes exist, commit them first (including any new features/fixes)
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

2. **Update Changelog** (REQUIRED - do this first!)
   ```bash
   # Edit CHANGELOG.md to add new version entry at the top
   # Include summary of changes for the upcoming version
   # Example: ## [2.2.1] - 2025-06-09
   #          ### Fixed
   #          - Fixed broken author link in Resources menu
   
   # Commit changelog updates along with any other changes
   git add CHANGELOG.md package.json  # (if package.json was also modified)
   git commit -m "Update changelog for version X.X.X - Brief description"
   ```

3. **Test Build**
   ```bash
   # Verify both development and production builds work
   npm run compile
   npm run package
   ```

4. **Version Bump and Git Release**
   ```bash
   # Choose version type based on changes:
   npm version patch    # For bug fixes: 2.2.0 ‚Üí 2.2.1
   npm version minor    # For new features: 2.2.0 ‚Üí 2.3.0
   npm version major    # For breaking changes: 2.2.0 ‚Üí 3.0.0
   
   # This automatically:
   # - Updates package.json version
   # - Creates a git commit with version bump
   # - Creates a git tag (e.g., v2.2.1)
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Push both commits and tags to remote repository
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

6. **Publish to Marketplace**
   ```bash
   # Publish to VSCode Marketplace (runs prepublish build automatically)
   vsce publish
   
   # This will:
   # - Run npm run vscode:prepublish (which runs npm run package)
   # - Build the extension with webpack
   # - Upload to marketplace
   # - Show success message with marketplace URL
   ```

7. **Verify Release**
   ```bash
   # Check recent commits and tags
   git log --oneline -5
   echo "---"
   git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5
   
   # Marketplace URL: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cartpauj.remote-file-browser
   ```

#### ‚úÖ Release Completion Checklist
- [ ] All code changes committed to git
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with new version entry
- [ ] Changelog committed along with any other changes
- [ ] `npm run compile` and `npm run package` completed successfully
- [ ] `npm version patch/minor/major` executed (auto-updates package.json and creates tag)
- [ ] `git push origin main --tags` completed (pushes commits and tags to GitHub)
- [ ] **`vsce publish` executed** (CRITICAL - publishes to marketplace)
- [ ] Verification: `git log` and `git tag` show new version
- [ ] Marketplace URL shows new version (may take a few minutes)
- [ ] Extension available for user updates

#### Files Updated Automatically During Release
- `package.json` - Version field updated by `npm version`
- `package-lock.json` - Updated automatically when package.json changes  
- Git history - New commit and tag created by `npm version`

#### Alternative: One-Command Publishing
```bash
# Option: Use vsce publish with auto-increment (skips git tagging)
vsce publish patch    # Auto-increments version and publishes
vsce publish minor    # Auto-increments version and publishes  
vsce publish major    # Auto-increments version and publishes

# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This method doesn't create git tags for version tracking
# The manual method above is RECOMMENDED for better version control
```

#### Common Release Issues
- **"Git working directory not clean"**: Commit all changes before `npm version`
- **"Tag already exists"**: Check if version was already bumped with `git tag`
- **"Authentication failed"**: Ensure you're logged into vsce with correct publisher credentials
- **"Package.json version mismatch"**: Don't manually edit version in package.json, use `npm version`

### Version Numbering Guidelines
- **Pre-1.0**: Use `0.x.x` for initial development
- **First Stable Release**: `1.0.0` when feature-complete
- **Bug Fixes**: Patch version (1.0.1)
- **New Features**: Minor version (1.1.0)
- **Breaking Changes**: Major version (2.0.0)

### Current Status
- **Current Version**: `0.0.1` (initial development)
- **Recommended First Release**: `1.0.0` (extension is feature-complete)
