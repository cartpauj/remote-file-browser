## Security Considerations
- Credentials stored using VSCode SecretStorage API
- SSH keys read from disk only during connection
- No credential caching in memory beyond connection duration
- PuTTY .ppk files (v2 and v3) converted to OpenSSH format in memory using ppk-to-openssh library
- SSH key processing happens securely in memory without temporary file creation
- Universal PPK support for both legacy (v2) and modern (v3) PuTTY key formats
- Temporary files organized in connection-specific directories with sanitized names
- Manual cleanup of temporary files and watchers prevents sensitive data accumulation
- Cross-platform filesystem safety with character sanitization for folder names

## Connection Identification System

The extension uses a multi-layered approach to connection identification, with different ID formats optimized for specific purposes:

### 1. File System Paths (Safe Directory Names)
- **Format**: `username-host-port` (e.g., `admin-example.com-22`)
- **Function**: `getConnectionTempDir()` ‚Üí `sanitizeFileName()`
- **Purpose**: Creating temporary directories that are safe across all operating systems
- **Sanitization**: Converts unsafe characters (`@`, `:`, `\`, `/`, etc.) to safe alternatives
- **Usage**: Temp file storage at `/tmp/remote-file-browser/{sanitized-name}/`

### 2. File Watcher Tracking (Logical Identification)
- **Format**: `username@host:port` (e.g., `admin@example.com:22`)
- **Function**: `generateConnectionId()`
- **Purpose**: Logical identification for file watchers and connection validation
- **Human-readable**: Used in error messages and user feedback
- **Usage**: Tracking which connection each opened file belongs to for security validation

### 3. Credential Storage (Unique Keys)
- **Format**: `protocol-username-host-port` (e.g., `sftp-admin-example.com-22`)
- **Function**: `CredentialManager.generateConnectionId()`
- **Purpose**: Unique credential storage keys that differentiate between protocols
- **Protocol-aware**: Prevents SFTP and FTP credentials from conflicting on same server
- **Usage**: VSCode SecretStorage API keys for passwords and passphrases

### Connection Cleanup Implementation
- **File Tree Trash Icon**: Deletes temp files for current connection only (uses filesystem-safe directory targeting)
- **Connection Manager Cleanup**: Deletes temp files for ALL connections (global cleanup)
- **File Watcher Cleanup**: Uses logical connection IDs to dispose watchers for specific connections
- **Security Validation**: Prevents files from being saved to wrong servers using logical connection matching

### Welcome Screen Command Architecture
- **Dynamic Command Registration**: Pre-registers individual commands for each connection index at extension startup
- **Argument-Free Design**: Commands like `remoteFileBrowser.connectFromWelcome.2` eliminate VSCode argument parsing issues
- **Double-Click Prevention**: Global connection lock (`isAnyConnectionInProgress`) prevents concurrent connection attempts
- **Scalable Registration**: Loop-based registration supports configurable number of connections (default: 20)

## Known Limitations
- Requires system keyring software for secure credential storage
- Large files may impact performance during transfer
- No support for SFTP/FTP advanced features (tunneling, etc.)
- Limited to password and private key authentication (no certificates, multi-factor, etc.)
- Recent connections based on order in configuration (not actual usage tracking)
- Temp file management uses terminal interface for all platforms

### SSH Key Format Support
- **Universal PPK Support**: Both PuTTY PPK version 2 (PuTTY 0.52-0.74) and PPK version 3 (PuTTY 0.75+) are fully supported
- **Automatic Conversion**: PPK files are automatically converted to OpenSSH format in memory using the ppk-to-openssh library
- **Supported Formats**: OpenSSH private keys (.pem, .key) and PuTTY PPK keys (.ppk) in all versions
- **No Manual Conversion Required**: Users can use PPK files directly without any preprocessing

### Multi-Window Compatibility Issues
- **Shared Temporary Directory Conflicts**: Multiple VSCode/Cursor windows connecting to the same server use identical temp file paths (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/user-at-server-22/`), causing file overwrite conflicts when opening the same remote files
- **Global File Watcher State**: File watchers are stored in Node.js global scope, causing cross-window interference when one window cleans up temp files (disposes watchers for all windows)
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple windows editing the same remote file can overwrite each other's changes, with whichever saves last winning
- **Cleanup Side Effects**: Running "Clean Up Temp Files" in one window affects file synchronization in all other windows
- **No Connection Isolation**: Extension lacks prevention mechanisms for multiple windows connecting to the same server simultaneously

## Security Improvements

### Connection-Aware File Watchers (Implemented)
- **Cross-Connection Upload Prevention**: File watchers now track which connection each file belongs to, preventing dangerous scenarios where files could be uploaded to the wrong server
- **Connection Validation on Save**: Before uploading any file, the system validates that the user is still connected to the same server that originally provided the file
- **Clear Error Messages**: When attempting to save a file from a different connection, users receive clear feedback like "Cannot save index.php - file belongs to user@serverA:22 but you're connected to admin@serverB:21"
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Uses existing sanitization and path handling systems to work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Breaking Changes**: Implementation preserves all existing functionality while adding safety validation

### Impact
This fix prevents data loss scenarios where:
- User opens file from Server A, disconnects, connects to Server B, and saves changes (would previously upload to Server B)
- Multi-server workflows could accidentally overwrite files on production servers with development content
- Files could be uploaded to wrong environments without user awareness

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Multi-Window Safety Improvements
- **Window-Specific Temp Directories**: Use window/instance identifiers in temp paths to prevent conflicts (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/window-${id}/user-at-server-22/`)
- **Instance-Level File Watchers**: Replace global file watcher state with per-window instance storage
- **Connection Locking**: Implement filesystem-based or process-level locking to prevent multiple windows from connecting to the same server
- **File Access Coordination**: Add file locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent edits of the same remote file across windows
- **Isolated Cleanup Operations**: Ensure temp file cleanup only affects the current window's resources
- **Connection State Visibility**: Add indicators showing which window is connected to which server

- `out/` - Compiled JavaScript files and source maps
- `node_modules/` - NPM dependencies
- `*.vsix` - Extension package files
- IDE and OS temporary files

#### Files to Include in Git
Essential files for the repository:
- `src/` - TypeScript source code
- `package.json` - Extension manifest and dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `README.md` - User documentation
- `PROJECT-SCOPE.md` - Technical documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git exclusion rules

#### Setting Up from GitHub

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd remote-file-browser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   # Development build (webpack bundling)
   npm run compile
   
   # Production build (minified)
   npm run package
   ```

4. **Development workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Watch for changes (auto-compile with webpack)
   npm run watch
   
   # Manual development build
   npm run compile
   
   # Production build
   npm run package
   
   # Test in Extension Development Host
   # Press F5 in VSCode/Cursor or use "Run Extension" in Run and Debug panel
   ```

5. **Installing the extension**:
   - Copy the entire project folder to your extensions directory:
     - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\` or `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\extensions\`
     - **macOS**: `~/.vscode/extensions/` or `~/.cursor/extensions/`
     - **Linux**: `~/.vscode/extensions/` or `~/.cursor/extensions/`
   - Restart VSCode/Cursor
   - The extension will appear in your extensions list

### Extension Bundling & Optimization

The extension uses **webpack bundling** for optimal performance and minimal package size:

- **Bundle Size**: Reduced from 6.2MB (573 files) to 237KB (18 files) - 96% size reduction
- **Build Process**: TypeScript ‚Üí Webpack ‚Üí Minified Bundle
- **Dependencies**: Native binary modules handled via node-loader
- **Exclusions**: Source files, tests, and dev dependencies excluded via `.vscodeignore`

#### Bundling Configuration
- **webpack.config.js**: Bundles TypeScript into single optimized file
- **node-loader**: Handles SSH2 native binary dependencies (.node files)
- **Production mode**: Minification and tree-shaking enabled
- **Source maps**: Hidden source maps for debugging without source exposure

### Building for Distribution

1. **Install packaging dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   npm install
   ```

2. **Package the extension** (automatically runs bundling):
   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```
   This runs `npm run vscode:prepublish` ‚Üí `npm run package` ‚Üí webpack bundling

3. **Manual bundling** (development):
   ```bash
   # Development bundle
   npm run compile
   
   # Production bundle (minified)
   npm run package
   ```

4. **Install from .vsix**:
   - In VSCode/Cursor: `Extensions` ‚Üí `...` ‚Üí `Install from VSIX...`
   - Select the generated `.vsix` file

This project provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly solution for remote file browsing without the overhead of traditional sync-based approaches. The extension offers seamless connectivity with intelligent temp file management, cross-platform compatibility, and an intuitive interface optimized for daily development workflows.
