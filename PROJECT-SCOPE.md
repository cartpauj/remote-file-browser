- **Connection Actions**: Connect, Edit, Delete buttons for each saved connection
- **Temp File Management**: View and clean up temporary files via shell interface

### 4. File Operations
- **On-demand File Access**: Files only downloaded when opened
- **Persistent Temporary Files**: Organized directory structure preserving remote paths
- **Connection-specific Storage**: `/tmp/remote-file-browser/connection-name/remote/path/file.txt`
- **Override Prompts**: Ask user when opening existing temp files whether to use cached or download fresh
- **Auto-sync on Save**: Changes automatically uploaded to remote server when file is saved
- **File Watcher**: Monitors local temp files for changes and syncs back
- **Manual Cleanup**: User-controlled cleanup via dedicated commands and GUI buttons

### 5. Security Features
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Passwords/passphrases stored in OS keychain
- **Graceful Keyring Fallback**: Handles missing keyring software gracefully
- **No Plaintext Storage**: Credentials never stored in settings or configuration files
- **User Consent**: Always asks permission before storing credentials

- Added basic file open/save operations
- Set up TypeScript configuration and build process

### Phase 2: User Experience Improvements
- Moved from Explorer sidebar to dedicated activity bar icon
- Added connection manager GUI with forms
- Implemented file sorting (folders first, alphabetical)
- Added welcome screen for disconnected state

### Phase 3: Authentication & Security
- Added SSH key authentication support
- Implemented secure credential storage
- Added file browser for SSH key selection
- Created graceful fallback for keyring issues

### Phase 4: Workflow Optimization
- Added connect buttons directly in connection manager
- Implemented auto-open connection manager on disconnect
- Added credential save prompts with user consent
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### Phase 5: Temp File Management & UI Improvements
- Implemented persistent temp files with organized directory structure
- Added connection-specific temp directories preserving remote paths
- Created override prompts for existing temp files (fresh vs cached)
- Implemented manual cleanup with shell interface for temp file management
- Added cross-platform temp file access via terminal interface

### Phase 6: Enhanced Welcome Experience
- Created dynamic welcome screen with recent connections tree view
- Added collapsible "Recent Connections" section showing up to 10 connections
- Implemented click protection with visual feedback during connection attempts
- Added spinning loading icons and "Connecting..." labels
- Removed auto-open connection manager on disconnect for cleaner UX
- Consolidated duplicate connection authentication code for maintainability

### Phase 7: Security & Connection Safety
- Implemented connection-aware file watchers to prevent cross-server file uploads
- Added validation to ensure files are only saved to their originating connections
- Enhanced file watcher storage to track connection metadata (username@host:port)
- Introduced clear error messages when attempting to save files to wrong servers
- Maintained cross-platform compatibility while adding security validation
- Prevented data loss scenarios in multi-server development workflows

## Configuration Schema
```json
{
  "remoteFileBrowser.connections": [
    {
      "name": "Server Name",
      "protocol": "sftp|ftp",
      "host": "hostname",
      "port": 22,
      "username": "username",
      "remotePath": "/",
      "authType": "password|key",
      "keyPath": "/path/to/ssh/key"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Credentials stored using VSCode SecretStorage API
- SSH keys read from disk only during connection
- No credential caching in memory beyond connection duration
- Temporary files organized in connection-specific directories with sanitized names
- Manual cleanup of temporary files and watchers prevents sensitive data accumulation
- Cross-platform filesystem safety with character sanitization for folder names

## Known Limitations
- Requires system keyring software for secure credential storage
- Large files may impact performance during transfer
- No support for SFTP/FTP advanced features (tunneling, etc.)
- Limited to basic authentication methods (no certificates, etc.)
- Recent connections based on order in configuration (not actual usage tracking)
- Temp file management uses terminal interface for all platforms

### Multi-Window Compatibility Issues
- **Shared Temporary Directory Conflicts**: Multiple VSCode/Cursor windows connecting to the same server use identical temp file paths (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/user-at-server-22/`), causing file overwrite conflicts when opening the same remote files
- **Global File Watcher State**: File watchers are stored in Node.js global scope, causing cross-window interference when one window cleans up temp files (disposes watchers for all windows)
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple windows editing the same remote file can overwrite each other's changes, with whichever saves last winning
- **Cleanup Side Effects**: Running "Clean Up Temp Files" in one window affects file synchronization in all other windows
- **No Connection Isolation**: Extension lacks prevention mechanisms for multiple windows connecting to the same server simultaneously

## Security Improvements

### Connection-Aware File Watchers (Implemented)
- **Cross-Connection Upload Prevention**: File watchers now track which connection each file belongs to, preventing dangerous scenarios where files could be uploaded to the wrong server
- **Connection Validation on Save**: Before uploading any file, the system validates that the user is still connected to the same server that originally provided the file
- **Clear Error Messages**: When attempting to save a file from a different connection, users receive clear feedback like "Cannot save index.php - file belongs to user@serverA:22 but you're connected to admin@serverB:21"
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Uses existing sanitization and path handling systems to work consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Breaking Changes**: Implementation preserves all existing functionality while adding safety validation

### Impact
This fix prevents data loss scenarios where:
- User opens file from Server A, disconnects, connects to Server B, and saves changes (would previously upload to Server B)
- Multi-server workflows could accidentally overwrite files on production servers with development content
- Files could be uploaded to wrong environments without user awareness

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Connection testing functionality
- Transfer progress indicators for large files
- Multiple file operations (copy, move, delete)
- Advanced SFTP features (symbolic links, permissions)
- Connection import/export
- Dark theme customization for connection manager
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Usage-based recent connections tracking
- Enhanced terminal interface features for temp file access
- Batch file operations and multi-selection support
- Connection grouping and organization features

### Multi-Window Safety Improvements
- **Window-Specific Temp Directories**: Use window/instance identifiers in temp paths to prevent conflicts (`/tmp/remote-file-browser/window-${id}/user-at-server-22/`)
- **Instance-Level File Watchers**: Replace global file watcher state with per-window instance storage
- **Connection Locking**: Implement filesystem-based or process-level locking to prevent multiple windows from connecting to the same server
- **File Access Coordination**: Add file locking mechanisms to prevent concurrent edits of the same remote file across windows
- **Isolated Cleanup Operations**: Ensure temp file cleanup only affects the current window's resources
- **Connection State Visibility**: Add indicators showing which window is connected to which server

- **node-loader**: Handles SSH2 native binary dependencies (.node files)
- **Production mode**: Minification and tree-shaking enabled
- **Source maps**: Hidden source maps for debugging without source exposure

### Building for Distribution

1. **Install packaging dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   npm install
   ```

2. **Package the extension** (automatically runs bundling):
   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```
   This runs `npm run vscode:prepublish` ‚Üí `npm run package` ‚Üí webpack bundling

3. **Manual bundling** (development):
   ```bash
   # Development bundle
   npm run compile
   
   # Production bundle (minified)
   npm run package
   ```

4. **Install from .vsix**:
   - In VSCode/Cursor: `Extensions` ‚Üí `...` ‚Üí `Install from VSIX...`
   - Select the generated `.vsix` file

This project provides a complete, secure, and user-friendly solution for remote file browsing without the overhead of traditional sync-based approaches. The extension offers seamless connectivity with intelligent temp file management, cross-platform compatibility, and an intuitive interface optimized for daily development workflows.

```bash
vsce publish patch    # Bug fixes: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1
vsce publish minor    # New features: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0  
vsce publish major    # Breaking changes: 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0
```

### Extension Build Process

The extension uses TypeScript source files that must be compiled to JavaScript before packaging:

**Source Files (`src/`):**
- `extension.ts` - Main extension entry point with all core functionality
- `connectionManager.ts` - SFTP/FTP connection handling
- `remoteFileProvider.ts` - Tree view provider for remote files  
- `connectionManagerView.ts` - Web-based connection management GUI
- `credentialManager.ts` - Secure credential storage
- `welcomeViewProvider.ts` - Dynamic welcome screen with recent connections

**Build Output (`out/`):**
- `extension.js` - Compiled main extension file (created from `extension.ts`)
- Additional `.js` files for each TypeScript module
- Source maps for debugging (`.js.map` files)

**When to Build:**
- **Development**: `npm run compile` or `npm run watch` (auto-rebuild on changes)
- **Pre-Release Testing**: `npm run package` (production build with webpack bundling)
- **Publishing**: Automatically triggered by `vsce publish` or `vsce package`

### Complete Release Workflow

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Ensure all changes are committed to git before starting the release process!**

#### Pre-Release Checklist
```bash
# 1. Check git status - must be clean before release
git status

# 2. If changes exist, commit them first:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md if needed (add new version entry)
# Edit CHANGELOG.md manually to document changes
```

#### Release Process

1. **Test Changes Locally**
   ```bash
   # Development build (creates out/extension.js from src/extension.ts)
   npm run compile
   
   # Production build with webpack bundling
   npm run package
   ```

2. **Package Extension for Testing**
   ```bash
   # Create .vsix package for local testing (auto-builds extension.js)
   vsce package
   
   # Install locally to test:
   # In VSCode: Extensions ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Install from VSIX
   # Select the generated .vsix file
   ```

3. **Update Changelog (if needed)**
   ```bash
   # Edit CHANGELOG.md to add new version entry before publishing
   # Include summary of changes for the new version
   
   # Commit changelog updates
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "Update changelog for version X.X.X"
   ```

4. **Publish to Marketplace**
   ```bash
   # CRITICAL: Ensure git working directory is clean first!
   git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   
   # Option A: Use npm version for proper versioning (RECOMMENDED)
   npm version patch    # For bug fixes: 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.1.1
   npm version minor    # For new features: 2.1.0 ‚Üí 2.2.0
   npm version major    # For breaking changes: 2.1.0 ‚Üí 3.0.0
   
   # Then publish to marketplace
   vsce publish
   
   # Option B: Direct vsce publish with version bump
   vsce publish patch    # Auto-increments version and publishes
   vsce publish minor    # Auto-increments version and publishes  
   vsce publish major    # Auto-increments version and publishes
   ```

5. **Create Standalone Package (Optional)**
   ```bash
   # Generate .vsix file for manual distribution
   vsce package
   
   # This creates a file like: remote-file-browser-2.1.1.vsix
   # Users can install this manually via:
   # Extensions ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Install from VSIX
   ```

6. **Post-Release Git Management**
   ```bash
   # Push version tags and commits to remote
   git push origin main --tags
   
   # Verify the release
   git log --oneline -5  # Check recent commits
   git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5  # Check recent tags
   ```
